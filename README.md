atom-fstar: Syntax highlighting for F* in Atom Editor
=====================================================

### Installation

Download and install [Atom] for your platform

[Atom]: https://atom.io/

Run `apm install`, followed by `apm link` from the root directory of this repository.

Any file with a `.fst` extension will trigger loading of the language-fstar mode.
For now, you only get very simple syntax highlighting.

### Building an F\* project

Install the [fstar-interactive] package

[fstar-interactive]: https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-interactive

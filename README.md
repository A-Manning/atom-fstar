FStarIDE: The beginnings of an IDE for F* within Atom Editor
============================================================

### Installation

Download and install [Atom] for your platform

[Atom]: https://atom.io/

Run the "install.sh" script included in this directory.
By default, we assume that atom packages are installed in ~/.atom/packages.
You may need to edit this to suit your installation.

Any file with a `.fst` extension will trigger loading of the language-fstar mode.
For now, you only get very simple syntax highlighting.
